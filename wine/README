  COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

** Dependences **

The main build dependency is a working mingw-w64 installation. It can be based on both GCC and Clang.
Wine installation is required to create MSI packages.


** Compiling wine_gecko **

To compile Wine Gecko package simply run wine/make_package script. See 'wine/make_package --help'
for available options. Also if you want to use parallel build, set MAKEOPTS environment variable to
something like -j4. You may also change default build dir by setting BUILD_DIR environment variable.

$ ./wine/make_package

If all goes well, you should have a complete package in ../wine_gecko-$TARGET$DEBUG-$VERSION/dist/wine_gecko

Official releases use llvm-mingw and are built with:
$ ./wine/make_package --all-packages -pdb
